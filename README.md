## Insipiration

It is a weekend and you found a good anime/series to binge-watch. But the effort of downloading all episodes (especially for series like One Piece üòÖ), the pain is unimaginable. _Ofcourse, you have an option to watch online, but what about people with poor unstable networks, or students with limited access to wifi_. So, this is created to help all such troubled souls. As Ikta Solorok once said: `Laziness is the mother of evolution`
